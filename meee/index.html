     <h2>Graphic Design Senior</h2>
     <p> ☞ My goal for the semester is to gain a basic understanding of web design.</p>
     <p> ☞ I am interested in the outdoors, which unforunately has little to do with web design.</p>
     <p> ☞ Curently, I do not know what I want to build for my final project. I don't want to be too ambitious because even this exercise took me longer than it probably should have.</p>
